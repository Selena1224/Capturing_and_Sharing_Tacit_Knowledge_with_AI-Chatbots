## Abstract
Tacit knowledge—embedded in employee experience and context—is one of the most difficult yet valuable organizational assets. Traditional methods like manuals or mentorship struggle to scale in modern workplaces.  

This paper investigates how AI-powered chatbots can make tacit knowledge more visible and reusable. It covers chatbot evolution, NLP pipelines, integration with enterprise systems, and barriers such as digital literacy, trust, and motivation. Findings show that chatbots are most effective when paired with human-centered practices, creating living systems where knowledge becomes shareable across teams and generations.
